# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Drand team actively supports the most recent minor version of drand.
Upcoming major or minor releases are announced with a prerelease at least one week in advance, and are communicated through the leagueofentropy@googlegroups.com email list.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please file an issue in this repository, and indicate that it is a vulnerability or security issue.
If you believe the issue is sensitive or can cause biasability, denial of service, or compromise of the active network,
please do not directly provide details, but instead provide a method for contacting you off-github, and the drand
contributors will reach out to get details from you and work towards a resolution.

We commit to updating security issues filed on github in this way on a weekly basis to indicate their current status towards resolution.
