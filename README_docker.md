# Batteries-included drand on Docker

The main readme is [here](./README.md). This README is somewhat not aligned with the Docker setup already proposed (I'm refering to the `Dockerfile` in the repo), *but* it is batteries-included: follow this guide (and only this one) to get a simple, resilient `drand` setup in Docker. In contrast, the docker setup in the repo is not built so the keys remains after recreating the image, etc.

## Prerequisites for this guide

a VPS with the following software setup:

1. `docker >= 17.12`
2. `docker-compose >= 1.18`

(but typically versions are not important)

on your host:

1. `go >= 1.12`

## Generate keys

Before creating the docker, let's generate keys locally (on the host)

	go get -u github.com/dedis/drand
	drand generate-keypair <address>

Where `<address>` is for instance `drand.yourserver.com:1234` or `yourserver.com:1234`.

This generates keys in `~/.drand/keys/` on the host.

## Docker & Docker-compose setup

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

	FROM golang:1.12.5-alpine # update this number when possible, but keep "alpine" for a lightweight image
	RUN apk update
	RUN apk upgrade
	RUN apk add git
	RUN go get -u github.com/dedis/drand
	WORKDIR /
	ENTRYPOINT ["drand", "--verbose", "2", "start", "--listen", "0.0.0.0:8080"]

**Note:** if you intend to use `drand` behind a reverse-proxy, add `--tls-disable` here; please read "Docker behind reverse proxy setup" at the end of this guide. 

Let's continue with docker-compose. It will help keeping our container running, plus manage volumes, etc.

Create the following `docker-compose.yml` :

	drand:
	  build: .
	  volumes:
	    - ./data:/root/.drand
	  ports:
	    - "0.0.0.0:1234:8080"

Finally, also create a `data` folder to hold the keys and settings. It __HAS__ to have permissions `740`.

	mkdir data
	chmod 740 data

Drand can then be built into an image with

	docker-compose up --build

Finally, the image is ready for DKG. Just start it and let it run in background with 

	docker-compose up -d

(one can also set a restart policy in the docker-compose.yml)

## DKG

If you did the setup above, you have a container running, loaded with your keys. It still misses two things:

1. the group.toml file corresponding to other participants. For this, you have to exchange keys manually, e.g., via email.
2. running the DKG protocol to bootstrap drand.

Fortunately, with our docker-compose volumes, it's now very easy to add things into the running container. Just add your `group.toml` into the root of the `data` folder (__NOT__ in the `data/groups/` folder; this one is manually managed by drand, don't touch it).

Then, open a CLI into your running docker.

First find its id on the host:

	$ docker ps
	697e4766f8b2        drand_drand             "drand --verbose 2 sâ€¦"   11 minutes ago      Up 9 minutes

The id of the container is `697e4766f8b2`. Enter it by running:

	docker exec -it 697e4766f8b2 /bin/sh

Then, you're inside the container; tell drand to run the DKG like so:

	drand share /root/.drand/group.toml

__Notice the full path__ `/root/.drand/group.toml` and not `group.toml` nor `./group.toml`

## Checking the logs

From outside the container, run `docker-compose logs`

## Updating drand

To update the docker, simply shut it down

	docker-compose down

and to fully rebuild it, you need to first clean the already-used layers (for some reason Docker is confused and thinks nothing has changed, and it keeps rebuilding the old version)

	docker system prune -a

Caution! this delete *all* your *unused* containers and networks; it's typically fine, but just be aware of it.

Then rebuild and restart it

	docker-compose up --build -d

## Something went wrong, reset (without losing the keys)

Kill the container:

	docker-compose down

Delete what you want to reset in `data`: typically, you absolutely want to __keep__ `data/keys`, __especially__ if you shared those keys to create a `group.toml` with other people. For instance if the DKG failed, remove `data/db` and `data/groups`. Notice that if you added the `group.toml` into the root of `data` as suggested, it should still be there (don't delete it unless you want to change the group).

Then, rebuild the image from scratch:

	docker system prune -a
	docker-compose up --build -d

Check that things are running with

	docker-compose logs

You're now back to the step "DKG" of this guide.

## Docker behind reverse proxy setup

Typically, the TLS part of my VPS is managed by a single reverse proxy, which then proxies multiple services running locally with docker.

There is one subtletly: you need to forward _both_ GRPC (used by drand "core") and web traffic (for the web interface). To forward GRPC, you need to have nginx `1.13.10` or above, it's a fairly recent addition.

Then, you need to forward differently traffic to `/` and to `/api/`. Here's an example configuration for `nginx`:

	server {
	  server_name drand.lbarman.ch;
	  listen 443 ssl http2;
	  ssl_protocols   SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
	  ssl_ciphers   HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
	  location / {
	    grpc_pass grpc://localhost:1234;
	  }
	  location /api/ {
	    proxy_pass http://localhost:1234; 
	    proxy_set_header Host $host;
	  }
	  
	  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
	  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
	}


Naturally, the local `drand` in the container does not need to worry about TLS anymore. Add the `--tls-disable` flag in the `Dockerfile`:

	ENTRYPOINT ["drand", "--verbose", "2", "start", "--tls-disable", "--listen", "0.0.0.0:8080"]

*But* notice that to others, you'll still be using TLS (handled by your reverse proxy), so make sure you generate keys using an https address, and the flag `TLS=true`.
